Individuals throughout Japanese culture have admired Ninomiya as the ideal model for youth who work hard and study diligently. As a radical reformer of agricultural management, people also recognize Ninomiya for introducing methods such as a survey of the long-term changes in population and annual harvest in specific rural areas, tax reduction policy, and incentives for farmers to increase production. Throughout Japanese society, people consider him as the leading activist and rationalist thinker within the 19th century. The followers of Ninomiya played a vital role during this period by contributing to the modernizing local agrarian communities and starting up new industries, such as textile manufacturing that utilized advanced machines. As a result, Japanese society has experienced very rapid modernization in every respect.","Academic Year":["2018-19"],"Legislative District Number":9,"College Name":["College of Arts and Sciences","Academic Affairs"],"Campus Partner":["Philosophy and Religious Studies","Barbara Weitz Community Engagement Center (CEC)"],"Community Partner":["Shizuoka University"],"Mission Area":["Economic Sufficiency"],"Community Partner Type":["Higher Education Institution"],"Address Line1":"6400 South, University Drive Road North,","City":"Omaha","State":"NE","Zip":"68182","Community CEC status":[]},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.0105345,41.25771]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Project Name":"Life of a Cathedral","Engagement Type":["Knowledge and Resource Sharing"],"Activity Type":["Workshop"],"Description":"A cathedral is more than its architecture.

Since the release of Thor in 2011, the Marvel cinematic universe\u2019s dysfunctional Nordic brothers have rarely seen eye to eye. This is true to the medieval source material of the Norse sagas. However, although the conflict between the two brothers is maintained in the movies, Marvel constrains the brothers' masculine gender identities in ways that are not present in the medieval source material. The first of the Medieval\/Renaissance Interdisciplinary Studies Community Conversations invites you to explore the ways in which the original saga material plays with notions of gender identity that the films have chosen to erase from Thor\u2019s and Loki\u2019s narratives in their transition from Norse gods to International Superhero and Villain. So reread Jason Aaron\u2019s and Russell Daughterman\u2019s \u201cMighty Thor Vol. 1: Thunder in Her Veins\u201d and rewatch Thor: Ragnarok and join us for a conversation about the characters Thor and Loki across time and media.

More and more, the traditional national-international binary holds less meaning. With the increasing options for mediated communication and the increasing interdependence of economic and cultural products and meanings, the need to understand our teaching subjects within a global context becomes more vital. In addition, many faculty members have experienced taking students outside of the U.S., and according to them, the experiences of students who lack the preparation to encounter an environment that is new to them with curiosity and enthusiasm. Therefore, instructors may ask the following question: How do we responsibly broaden our content, examples, and class activities to include teaching content from a greater variety of cultures and regions?\r\n\r\nThe presentation will address the objective of developing global mindfulness in teaching broadly considered. The presentation will also be relevant to students who want to increase their intercultural communication competence and global mindset.

Almost from the moment of the discovery, others have disagreed with Andronikos. Yet Tomb II contained not only a male burial but also that of a woman. Military equipment made it clear that she had been buried as a warrior. Her burial resembles the male in a number of aspects, including a slightly smaller and simpler golden burial box with the same starburst pattern, as well as a distinctive Scythian bow-and-arrow case and an elaborately decorated gold cuirass.
