The loss can be especially difficult as others may not fully appreciate the impact of the loss of a non-family member. The first of three programs for the 2018 Begin With the End in Mind series will discuss Disenfranchised Grief, grief that is not recognized by others. The term, disenfranchised grief was first described by Kenneth Doka and continues to have meaning today as more people live well into their older adult years and face the loss of friends, co-workers and neighbors. Cathy Fox, MSW is the first presenter. She is the Director of Operations for Grief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Journey (formerly Ted E. Bear Hollow). In her role she is responsible for development, implementation, and management of all Grief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Journey programs. Her passion for the care and support of grieving families is evident in her work.
