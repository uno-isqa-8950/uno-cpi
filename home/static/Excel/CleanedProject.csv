It introduces biomimicry and teaches a few of nature’s secrets to truly being a sustainable leader—for oneself and for the world. Biomimicry—a practice of discovering and listening to nature’s time-tested patterns and strategies—provides a framework to learn how to thrive in the midst of dynamic change and have a positive impact in our world. How does nature maintain energy in the face of constant change? How does nature adapt to conditions outside of its control? How does nature invest in strategies with the highest impact given an organism or ecosystem’s various needs? These are a few questions nature’s wisdom can answer in our quest for sustainable leadership.

The ultimate implications of this view are then projected onto an extended evolutionary perspective of our cosmos, encompassing rising levels of complexity from physical to biological, psychological, and social levels. Considering the exponential rise of artificial intelligence in the future post-information society, the talk is concluded with an urgent call for all creativity researchers to join forces in the diffusion of a discipline of creativity, with relevant educational programs.

The Female Burial in Royal Tomb II at Vergina: 2017-18 (001),Knowledge/Info Sharing,Training / Workshop / Presentation,Barbara Weitz Community Engagement Center (CEC),"The UNO History Department invites you to join presenter Elizabeth Carney, Ph.D., from Clemson University, as she discusses the ancient female warrior found in a royal tomb in Vergina, Greece. Forty years ago this November, Manolis Andronikos found three tombs at Vergina in Greece that he considered royal, one of which he believed to be that of Philip II, the great Macedonian king, general, and father of Alexander the Great. Almost from the moment of the discovery, others have disagreed with Andronikos. Yet Tomb II contained not only a male burial but also that of a woman. Military equipment made it clear that she had been buried as a warrior. Her burial resembles the male in a number of aspects, including a slightly smaller and simpler golden burial box with the same starburst pattern, as well as a distinctive Scythian bow-and-arrow case and an elaborately decorated gold cuirass. While the lecture plans to discuss the identity of both occupants, the intended focus is to discuss primarily the woman. That is, who she was and why she was buried as a warrior.

This event will take a closer look at how student debt can affect women, particularly women of color, following graduation as they enter the workforce. AAUW helps shed light on intersected issues including the gender wage gap and provides a foundation of research and resources to our communities as we ask what can be done about student debt.
