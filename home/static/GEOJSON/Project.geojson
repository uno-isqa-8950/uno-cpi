We will avail ourselves of technical journals, art books, strange silent films, unclassifiable texts books on ceramics, glass, antique snuff boxes and clocks constructivist towers, Brutalist structures, weird interiors, stylized ruins, Victorian bric-a-brac and ancient vessels and all manner of bizarre tomes and dream books. And you will write as much as you have ever written in one day. The transformation of the real and the making of speculative worlds. Living in and through the imagination.",

Service learning is a pedagogy that connects community service with academic course content and objectives. Service learning pedagogies have been carried out in chemistry at the college level. This is a multiple-case study embedded within a one-semester Honors College General Chemistry II seminar. Findings indicate that the students developed more specific knowledge and appreciation of the community and expressed their intention to continue volunteering to improve academic and scientific skills. Implications of this pedagogy for chemistry teaching and learning are discussed.",

        "Description":"The loss of a friend- co-worker- or neighbor can be difficult- especially for those who have come to rely on these people over a lifetime. The loss can be especially difficult as others may not fully appreciate the impact of the loss of a non-family member. The first of three programs for the 2018 Begin With the End in Mind series will discuss Disenfranchised Grief- grief that is not recognized by others. The term- disenfranchised grief was first described by Kenneth Doka and continues to have meaning today as more people live well into their older adult years and face the loss of friends- co-workers and neighbors. Cathy Fox- MSW is the first presenter. She is the Director of Operations for Grief\u00ef\u00be\u0095s Journey (formerly Ted E. Bear Hollow). In her role she is responsible for development- implementation- and management of all Grief\u00ef\u00be\u0095s Journey programs. Her passion for the care and support of grieving families is evident in her work. Like past programming- this session promises to enlighten those who want to learn more about end of life concerns and wishes. Begin With the End in Mind discussions are free and open to the public including all staff and faculty in the UN system.",

Among these was Andrea de\u00ef\u00be\u0095 Franceschi (1473-1552)- the Grand Chancellor of the Venetian Republic. De' Franceschi was an elite government official at the top of his game who is also notable for his several portraits. One of these\u00ef\u00be\u0091attributed to the workshop of Titian\u00ef\u00be\u0091is now at the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. Using state of the art technology- Rebecca Norris- Ph.D.- and a collaborative team delved beneath the surface of the Andrea de' Franceschi portrait. X-rays- infrared reflectography- and pigment sampling revealed layers of evidence that align with Titian\u00ef\u00be\u0095s workshop practices. Some of the evidence may even point to Titian himself.",

Better Together is designed to assist child welfare-referred parents who are struggling with substance abuse issues, and their children (see logic model). Process evaluation components determine if services were delivered as intended, how multiple stakeholders worked together to deliver the services, client satisfaction, and to provide a cost-benefit analysis of the program. The outcome evaluation components will determine the outcomes for the families, parents, and children. A nonequivalent quasiexperimental time series research design with follow-up will be utilized with standardized measurement tools. Qualitative research will be utilized to capture rich data for both process and outcome evaluation purposes. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews will be conducted with Better Together parents. The sample available for the second year's outcome evaluation is anticipated to be 25 families in the experimental group (Better Together) and 25 families in the Treatment As Usual (TAU) group.",

Many people were shocked and saddened by the violence that came out of the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville Virginia on August 11 and 12, 2017 especially when it came to light that three people (one civilian and two state police troopers) were killed during the events of the August 12 rally. Much has been written since the events on intersecting questions of race and racism the nature of protests the function of historical memory and the role of authorities before during and after the events. This talk attempts to understand what happened that day from a particular angle: It aims to ask what sort of violence or threats of violence were present on August 11 and 12 whether the violence was sanctioned (police presence) or unsanctioned (street brawling) and how we might sort out and understand the various uses of violence or threat of violence in a chaotic protest situation.",

Becky Haddix, outreach specialist for Girl Scouts Spirit of Nebraska, was organizing an after-school public service project at an area park for a group of Girl Scouts. But after talking with the Nebraska Watershed Network, Nebraskans for Civic Reform, and the Black Police\r\nOfficers Association, the project became educational and social. Levi Carter Park, with its lake, was a built-in ecosystem and the perfect place for the Nebraska Watershed Network to give the girls an onsite science lesson. And with the Black Police Officers Association providing supplies for s\u2019mores to break the ice, the event had the makings of a promising field trip. The girls learned things like water conservation, and were introduced to terms like the watershed, quality indexing, agrichemical runoff, and coliform. Partnering with the Black Police Officers Association provided an opportunity for the girls to form positive relationships with the officers.",

Shakespeare\u2019s focus was, therefore, restricted to male-dominated casts and masculine-centric plots (only 16% of all the lines written in his plays are delivered by female characters). https:\/\/www.unomaha.edu\/community-engagement-center\/news\/events\/2019\/03\/coupled-and-inseparable.php\r\n\r\nNow, even though women make up over 70% of the total Shakespeare viewing audience, less than one-fourth of professional directors and designers are women. In performance, the opportunities for men outnumber those available to women 8 to 1. In response to the imbalance of female artistic representation in Shakespeare\u2019s productions, Nebraska Shakespeare launched Juno\u2019s Swans in 2016, a program producing Shakespeare works that explores his characters and text through the female experience and perspective. \r\n\r\nIn this lecture, featuring exciting live performances by Nebraska Shakespeare actors, Sarah Brown, Artistic Director of Nebraska Shakespeare, will explore Shakespeare\u2019s relationship with women, the history of crossed-gendered theatre, and will engage in free-form discussion about how producing Shakespeare with a feminine perspective can illuminate the universal humanity of his plays in a new and surprising way.",

A pizza lunch will also be provided during this time.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s overcrowd the prison with our favorite books! Please bring your favorite book to the symposium to donate to the Omaha Correctional Center. They need copies of fiction, poetry, and some nonfiction for their library.\r\n\r\nPanel 1: Writing Corrections\r\nNicholas Bell and Tyrone Harper III of Writer\u2019s Block, Carmala Aderman of Hero\u2019s Journey, and Steve Langan and Alana Alexander of Programming Life 101 will discuss the creative writing that occurs within and beyond spaces of confinement.\r\n\r\nPanel 2: Education and Re-entry\r\nDiane Good-Collins and formerly incarcerated individuals who are transitioning from correctional facilities will discuss some of the educational opportunities offered by the Metropolitan Community College\u2019s 180 Re-Entry program.\r\n\r\nKeynote Speaker: Dominique Morgan\r\nDominique Morgan is the national director of Black and Pink, the largest prison abolitionist organization in the United States. Partnering his lived experience of incarceration as a youth (which included 18 months in solitary confinement), and a decade of change making advocacy and background in public health, Dominique continues to work in spaces of sex education, radical self-care, and youth development with intentions of dismantling the prison industrial complex and the impact it has on our community.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Prison Post-Secondary Education Project was created with the belief that education is one solution to America's prison problem. This program was developed in Fall 2017 through private funding to create a partnership between the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO) and the Omaha Correctional Center (OCC). The primary purpose of this project is to offer UNO courses, taught by UNO professors, lecturers and instructors, within OCC.",

The series, which runs Saturday, Aug. 26, through Wednesday, Sept. 27, was curated in part by students and faculty from UNO's Women and Gender Studies program. Additional support for the series came from UNO's Gender and Sexuality Resource Center. As part of the series, three of the films are directly co-sponsored by the UNO Women and Gender Studies program: 1) Tuesday, Sept. 12, will feature a sing-along of the musical \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch,\" which tells the story of a gender-fluid punk rocker from East Berlin. A post-film discussion will be lead by UNO sociology professor Jay Irwin. 2) Tuesday, Sept. 19, will feature \"Pariah,\" the story of a Brooklyn teen who embraces her identity as a lesbian while navigating how her identity affects her relationship with family and friends. A post-film panel will feature a group of national scholars who will discuss queer and intersectional identities in film. 3) Tuesday, Sept. 26, will feature a screening of \"The Watermelon Women,\" with director Cheryl Dunye. The film is a documentary about Dunye's experiences trying to uncover the history of a 1930s black actress known simply as \"The Watermelon Woman\" while experiencing and uncovering secrets in her own life.\r\n\r\nPrior to the film's showing, on Sunday, Sept. 17, the UNO Women and Gender Studies program is joining the Nebraska Writer's Collective to host a \"Gender Revolt! Poetry and Spoken Word Open Mic\" at Muglife Coffee, 2452 Harney St., from 6 to 8 p.m.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.unomaha.edu\/news\/2017\/08\/uno-groups-partner-with-film-streams-for-lgbtqia-film-series.php",

The UNO students taught 5 sessions throughout the semester in either Ms. Colon (English and Yearbook) or Ms. George (Arts and Computer Graphics) classes. SPED 4750 students learned to work hands-on in any type of classroom (\u201cLanguage is Everywhere\u201d) and BAP students received learning assistance in their respective classrooms. As a community partner, the Joslyn Art Museum worked with the Blackburn students to create podcasts focusing on the various art installments at the Joslyn. The Blackburn students\u2019 podcasts can be heard on the Joslyn Art Museum's YouTube channel.",

YU is located in Gyeongsan, neighboring the metropolitan city of Daegu and just two hours by train from South Korea\u2019s capital, Seoul. YU offers a large number of courses in English, beginning Korean language classes, a thriving international student population, and is one of the most affordable exchange programs. UNO students have the opportunity to be an English conversation tutor for 4 hours per week in the Language Partner Program at YU, and receive a monthly stipend for their time. This is a wonderful way for students to help cover their expenses while in Korea and to meet local students. Internships are another hands on experience YU can support, and they are able to help qualified exchange students obtain a local internship. As of the 2020\/2021 academic year, 41 UNO students have studied at YU and 27 YU students have studied at UNO. YU students have also come to UNO for short-term intensive English programs at ILUNO as part of this partnership.",

        "Description":"In this paper, Zhigang Feng and others studied the interaction between health disparity and income inequality. They extend the prototypical macro health model in several directions. Their model considers the impact of health on labor earning and medical spending. Moreover, they identify a \"health premium\" of insurance coverage that the insured is more likely to stay healthy or recover from unhealthy status. They hence modeled the effects of income on health and mortality risk through endogenous health insurance choice. All these extensions are essential to simulate the observed joint distribution of income and health status, household's health insurance choice, and medical spending by income level and over their life cycle. Quantitative analysis reveals a significant impact of individual's income in early life on their health at adulthood, which will be reinforced by and subsequently amplify the negative effect of bad health on labor earning and income inequality. They conducted comparative analysis of health policies intended to alleviate health disparity and income inequality. Providing universal insurance coverage will narrow the health and life expectancy gap. Such policy benefits lower skilled the most, which adds additional weight to the poor in the aggregate income distribution and counteracts the positive effect of improved health on income inequality. While the implementation of universal basic income reduces income inequality and mean-tested public insurance will attenuate its effect on health disparity.",

STEPs uses a participatory, utilization-focused approach to all its work. Participatory means that program staff are engaged in all evaluation activities, including their planning and implementation. Utilization-focused means that evaluation activities are conducted with an eye toward usefulness for the program. As a coalition, PMP has both staff and coalition members\/committees who hold a stake in this program evaluation project.

They are part of a collection of 24 stone lanterns that were formerly displayed in several gardens in the sister city, Shizuoka, Japan. Some are more than 75 years old and were gifted to the people of Omaha.\r\n\r\nLanterns became part of Japanese architectural ornamentation about 1,400 years ago, where they first associated with Buddhist templates and pagodas. Cultural activities were also part of the festival including calligraphy, origami, samurai helmet making, chopstick game, traditional games and toys, tea tasting, Kyudo archery demonstrations, paper arts workshops, Japanese music and drummers, martial arts, and more.",

No identifiable information about the spices was collected, therefore we will not be reporting to families or DCDH if the spices tested positive for lead.  \r\nP-16\r\nCHEM 1144.001",

The evaluation question to be answered is: To what degree does the National Safety Council, Nebraskas diversion program reduce recidivism? This study will compare recidivism outcomes for three groups: 1) individuals who completed the diversion program; 2) individuals who started but did not complete the diversion program; and 3) individuals who did not participate in the diversion program. The diversion program is a voluntary program that offers a one-time chance for a person charged with certain crimes to avoid having a criminal conviction on their record. Participants pay an enrollment fee, complete community service, and complete a class. The results of this study will aid the Misdemeanor Diversion Program (MDP) in continuing, improving, and marketing their program.",

Global Sprint is designed to be a fast-paced, two-day event to hack and build projects for a healthy Internet. Held at the Barbara Weitz Community Engagement Center, Global Sprint in Omaha will focus on the creation of a new project, Omaha Parks. The city has no user-friendly portal for aiding the discovery of parks, or for searching or filtering parks based on their amenities. Omaha Parks will seek to bridge that gap by building an interactive map to aid citizens in discovering parks that fit their needs and wants. Omaha Parks is an open source project and values open collaboration. Anyone wishing to take part in Global Sprint is free to come by anytime and stay for as short or as long as they\u2019d like. And the collaboration continues afterward on Github; if you\u2019re unable to attend, discover the community online. Tickets and more information about the event can be found online here.

Normal is Over is a compelling and visually rich film that chronicles the way humans have inadvertently imperiled our planet: species extinction, climate change, the depletion of critical natural resources, and industrial control of our food production. This unique documentary examines how our economic and financial system connects all of these issues, and offers solutions, which could be implemented immediately, from practical everyday fixes to rethinking the overarching myths of our time. The film follows Renee Scheltema on a multinational voyage, meeting not only prominent experts, but also everyday citizens who concentrate on matters such as organic agriculture, the banning of plastic, saving species, ecological economics, sustainable architecture, renewable energy, and more.",

Earlier this fall, WhyArts artist Stephanie Anderson advised UNO director Lucas Perez-Leahy on developing a performance for Transitions Program participants inspired by \u201cThe Secret Garden,\u201d which kicked off UNO Theatre\u2019s 2018-19 fall season. The Transitions Program provides opportunities for young adults ages 18 to 25 who identify on the autism spectrum to practice and enhance social competencies.\r\n\r\n\u201cUNO\u2019s School of the Arts is squarely focused on strengthening our sense of community by developing the powers of perception and empathy,\u201d said Jack Zerbe, director of the School of the Arts at UNO. \u201cCollaborating with WhyArts, the Autism Society and UNO Transitions is a shining example of how UNO\u2019s arts programs bring people together to foster understanding and make connections. I am pleased to have provided increased access to the arts but even more delighted that our students got to work so closely with our special new partners and friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOur Secret Garden\u201d was immediately followed by the final performance of UNO Theatre\u2019s \u201cA Secret Garden.\u201d Below, Jack Zerbe and Carolyn Anderson, director of WhyArts, address the audience before the premiere.",

She joined UNO as full-time faculty in 2016 after receiving her PhD in Sociology from the University of Las Vegas, Nevada. Her academic and activist work focuses on labor rights, gender, sexuality, and feminist theory more generally. In 2014, she was awarded a $15,000 grant to study students engaged in sex work, which was the topic of her dissertation. In Nevada, she was the director of the Sex Worker\u2019s Outreach Project, a labor rights non-profit and sat on the board of the national organization of the same name. Additionally, she worked with the Nevada Public Health Alliance for Syringe Access, Amnesty International, the U.S. Department of Justice, National Geographic, and the Discovery Channel on issues related to sex work, sex trafficking, drug use, and homelessness. She currently chairs the Conflict, Social Action, and Change Division of the Society for the Study of Social Problems.\r\n\r\nAs a researcher and educator, her philosophies come from critical pedagogy and community-based research. She hopes to expand on her research interests in Nebraska by working with grass-roots labor organizations focused on the needs of sex workers.  \r\n\r\nThe Midlands Sexual Health Research Collaborative (MSHRC) Student Organization",

        "Description":"UNO Medieval Renaissance Studies Lecture Series invites you to its first Community Conversation: Dr. Frank Bramlett and Dr. Lisabeth Buchelt (UNO-English Department) will engage participants in a discussion focused around the intersection of the present with the past and the interconnections between the Norse sagas and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Since the release of Thor in 2011, the Marvel cinematic universe\u2019s dysfunctional Nordic brothers have rarely seen eye to eye. This is true to the medieval source material of the Norse sagas. However, although the conflict between the two brothers is maintained in the movies, Marvel constrains the brothers' masculine gender identities in ways that are not present in the medieval source material. The first of the Medieval\/Renaissance Interdisciplinary Studies Community Conversations invites you to explore the ways in which the original saga material plays with notions of gender identity that the films have chosen to erase from Thor\u2019s and Loki\u2019s narratives in their transition from Norse gods to International Superhero and Villain. So reread Jason Aaron\u2019s and Russell Daughterman\u2019s \u201cMighty Thor Vol. 1: Thunder in Her Veins\u201d and rewatch Thor: Ragnarok and join us for a conversation about the characters Thor and Loki across time and media. This program is funded in part by Humanities Nebraska and the Nebraska Cultural Endowment and is sponsored by UNO's English Department and the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.",

Cephalophory is the ability of a dead saint to carry their own severed head or ask another to pick up the body part and carry it to a chosen site for burial. This kind of narrative was common in medieval saints\u2019 cults and served to authenticate relics, demonstrate their power, and establish their presence at the particular site. Montgomery plans to discuss these narratives on January 25, 2018. Scott B. Montgomery is Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Denver. He is the author of Saint Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne, Relics, Reliquaries and the Visual Culture of Group Sanctity in Late Medieval Europe, and Casting Our Own Shadows: Recreating the Medieval Pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (co-author with Alice A. Bauer).",

The ultimate implications of this view are then projected onto an extended evolutionary perspective of our cosmos, encompassing rising levels of complexity from physical to biological, psychological, and social levels. Considering the exponential rise of artificial intelligence in the future post-information society, the talk is concluded with an urgent call for all creativity researchers to join forces in the diffusion of a discipline of creativity, with relevant educational programs.

Forty years ago this November, Manolis Andronikos found three tombs at Vergina in Greece that he considered royal, one of which he believed to be that of Philip II, the great Macedonian king, general, and father of Alexander the Great. Almost from the moment of the discovery, others have disagreed with Andronikos. Yet Tomb II contained not only a male burial but also that of a woman. Military equipment made it clear that she had been buried as a warrior. Her burial resembles the male in a number of aspects, including a slightly smaller and simpler golden burial box with the same starburst pattern, as well as a distinctive Scythian bow-and-arrow case and an elaborately decorated gold cuirass. While the lecture plans to discuss the identity of both occupants, the intended focus is to discuss primarily the woman. That is, who she was and why she was buried as a warrior.",

Network approaches can highlight patterns and reveal missing pieces, triggering a creative spark or a breakthrough idea. All workshops are free and open to the public. Attendees should plan to participate in an introductory session before an advanced workshop. Limited complimentary parking will be available in the lot directly north of the Weitz CEC. UNO undergraduate and graduate students will be able to continue exploring this subject after the workshops by collecting and analyzing creative network data at the UNO Social Media Lab.\r\n\r\nThe Social Media Lab reviewed the involvement on social media, with around 79 people engaged in the activity on Twitter (other platforms were used for people to engage in the activity but no report of those numbers). There were roughly 150 students from 4 different classes.",
