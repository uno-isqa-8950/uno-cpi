Students will also be able to interact with Nelson Mandela scholars during other engagement opportunities, including the “Be Ready” and Social Skills groups in the mornings and the Kids Can after-school program.  “Be Ready” is held from 7:00 – 8:00 am and focuses on learning executive functioning skills such as mindfulness, memory, and self-control. The social skills classes taught by Mr. Joe Ogba are from 8:10 – 8:30 am. The interactions and expectations for the social skills course will be discussed with Mr. Ogba during the orientation meeting.

Forty years ago this November, Manolis Andronikos found three tombs at Vergina in Greece that he considered royal, one of which he believed to be that of Philip II, the great Macedonian king, general, and father of Alexander the Great. Almost from the moment of the discovery, others have disagreed with Andronikos. Yet Tomb II contained not only a male burial but also that of a woman. Military equipment made it clear that she had been buried as a warrior. Her burial resembles the male in a number of aspects, including a slightly smaller and simpler golden burial box with the same starburst pattern, as well as a distinctive Scythian bow-and-arrow case and an elaborately decorated gold cuirass. While the lecture plans to discuss the identity of both occupants, the intended focus is to discuss primarily the woman. That is, who she was and why she was buried as a warrior.", "semester": "Fall 2017", "totalOfNumberUNOStudent": 0.0, "totalUNOStudentsHours": 0.0, "totalOfNumberK12Member": 0.0, "totalK12Hours": 0.0, "totalEconomomicImpact": 0.0, "numUNOfaculty/staff": 0.0, "numberOtherCommunityMembers": 70.0, "Entered By:": "Weitz CEC"}}, {"type": "Feature", "id": 639, "geometry": null, "properties": {"name": "The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial is Threatening our Planet, Destroying our Politics, and Driving us Crazy", "ProjectPrimaryMission": "Environmental Stewardship", "PrimaryCommunityPartner": "Sierra Club Nebraska Chapter", "PrimaryCampus Partner": "Sustainability, Office of", "engagementType": "knowledge/info sharing", "Activity_type": "training / workshop / presentation", "facilitator": "Weitz CEC", "description": "Distinguised climate scientist Dr. Michael E.
